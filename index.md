# Welcome to my site, I'm Juliano—that is my name! :D

I write stuff, I witness to people about the Bible—I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses. I make tutorials and I write things about myself and other things in my life. Feel free to read 'em!

My tutorial about making macOS usb in Linux or Windows, read it [here](extras/macos_usb.md)
