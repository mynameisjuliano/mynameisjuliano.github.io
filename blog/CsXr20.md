# Dear Casandra

I want to, first, apologize if I transgressed your obvious wish to have no further contact with me--seeing that you've blocked me, and disabled your accounts known by me in almost every conceivable way, and if this feels intrusive to you.

I just want to really offer my sincerest apologies for many things, I wanted to approach you personally earlier, but I failed to find an oppurtunity to do so, and ofcourse, I do not wish to fire or start an issue, so, I just refrained from doing so. I really wanted to do such a thing ever since May, but, I wasn't able to get some talking with you, so, I haven't really said how sorry I was for the things I've rashly spoke, and really leaving you hanging like that, and seemingly trying to come back, or atleast do some amends.

I want to make things clear, ever since you've drawn the line that you no longer feel having any romantic dealings within us, I was on the same page, and I really didn't want to go any further, since you've expressed already you don't want to further it. I do, however, wanted to know why you avoid me aloof like that, when I was in attending at your congregation back in June. I just thought I can come back since it was still a trouble adjusting in a new congregation.

I mean, after all, we sort of conversed for a while, it's something, is it not? It feels terrible when someone you sort of know just starts avidly avoiding you. Frankly, I do not understand why. I wanted to know what's up, and so, I tried finding a way to know. It was the last I was able to try.

That field service morning, when I was able to join you, was nothing short of a miracle, literally no one told me how to find you, I just--due to unrelated events happening--happened to find you and your group. No one told me the group's meeting venue or any information. Someone did tell me something, but it was outdated, no one was ever in that place that was told me.

I was really begging Jehovah for his help with trying to do amends with you, so, I saw that this might be his hand. I again repeat that I had no info, nor anything to go much to know where you are, and the presiding overseers in your group sort of lowhandedly encourage me to try and do it--that is, to probably volunteer at your group. So, I did, and as you of course know, I was there in the group you were preaching with. 

I prepared even a precipatory gift, just some milk tea, and what I should speak of. So, after the territory's over, I tried approaching you. But, you seemed to be frightened by this move that I've made. In fact, I'm pretty sure, its report to the elders is the reason that caused my being prohibited, that is, practically disallowed, to preach in your congregation, unless some elders explicitly granted. I was really saddened by that, I was surprised with it. I really wish I could have explained things with you. But, I'm sorry for things I've done, things I've said. Also, some things I caused you to feel. 

It's really bad that I just left you out, and, some close people said that you were probably emotionally affected, I'm sorry, I wish things gone out better. I'm sorry, if I kind of bring on pressure on you, whenever I was there to go attend, I feel like you're making an effort to really avoid crashing onto me.

I regret of course letting you fall with me, to even cause you to go through something like that. I was stupid, it was slight in my judgement. I'm the one who probably must be preventing things like this, and, obviously, there was a mishap. I'm sorry for the things I caused in your spiritual part of things, I wish I could say an apology personally. But this wish was not granted today, so, I hope, with all the sense this letter would make, my message can get through. 

I'm really genuinely amazed with how your comments became. They are really impressive at times. I'm sure your spiritual routine is doing great, you are really impressive. I'm sure Jehovah is happy with whatever efforts you are making. You seem to have good choice of associates too. I just wanted to really express how amazed I was to witness how much you're doing, you are one wonderful servant. I'll say this, regardless if you don't desire seeing me, or naught. I hope this continues, good day.

-- Sincerely,
    Juliano
