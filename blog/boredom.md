# boredom

### background
I met someone visiting, made a joke (or "witty" remark) infront of people about her beauty, (as a, intentionally, compliment.) also 

asked socials, had pictures with said person, but was gonna ask for personal (1v1)  pics.

I was also, like, weirdly, dabbing on Nihongo, I yet really understand why, it reflected

in words in lyrics, also, I often go on journeys, like, promptly, so, I often go places,

with unconventional preparations, that is, seemingly lack of such.
that's like, all, I think. 

Rough edges, and all, its fun.

### poem? lyric? I was trying to do something, some music-writing?
Stuck in the house, just doing something

Just doing my job as an all-for-nothing

Listening to songs that just don't make sense

Lyrics I don't like, ~[so full of]~ is just under pretense


Occupied yet feeling really empty

Euphoria dominates when you're inside my mind

When happiness I search for, you're the one that I find. (You the one, I could find)


There are 24 hours in day

But sometimes, this is all that I just could say

There's not much to do

But to think of you (yeah, that's just true)


I'm sorry, its becoming a habit too


"HELLO, HELLO," I said to the phone.

The neighbour heard me, but they know I'm alone

"I would like to speak to you," I said in a soft voice

Even if there's many things to do, this will always be my greatest choice


"I made a poem, would you like to hear?"

"I don't know you, please disappear."

"MOSHI, MOSHI," I said in loudly.

Know, I'm staring at my book blanky.


"I speak Japanese, would you like talk?"

"Don't bother me, I'm going for a walk."

You've cut the connection

While I'm thinking about my decision
> (here's nihingo influence, ig?)

"Should have I really done that to begin with?"

Doing ridiculous things like a kid
> (regrets)

Just scrolling through my feed.

Saw an advice—never going to heed.

Oh, I saw something funny pop up

But it's not something someone with a sense of humour would come up


Spending time with these sites is never best

So I said, “I'm done—I'm walking from here to west.”

Got away from home

got lost, forgot my foam

It's the night, the mosquitos bite

I'm hungry, walking with all my might

Fluttering from head to toe, it's cold

Regretting everything, realizing that I was too bold

I even asked your account

Wondering what you are all about

You told a joke

I nearly choked

"You are so hilarious," 

“So funny, so ridiculous”

Saying the things that are best

Since I'm trying to impress

My sister said you're too good for me

I said in my mind, "just let it be.”

My hope to be with you

Is only .00001 (point zero zero zero zero one) out of two

You are so far away

We are just only two straws in a hay

Maybe we'll meet other good people

But know that we saw each other in the middle

You may forget me, but I will never do so

All I wish is for you to be happy, no,

All I wish is for you is the best

While I'm still lost wandering the west

I'm still venturing aimlessly

Realized that there's the road, didn't observed carefully

I was just only a few meters away

I didn't know how I missed the sideway

So distracted with your beauty

Can't blame me, you are just such a cutie

I might not know how to get back

But in your presence, there's nothing that I lack

You are not here, I feel like I have nothing

Though, you've replaced my emptiness with something

When I think of you, I'm no longer bored.

So excuse me, if there will be many pictures of you that I will hoard.


Ending a poem, I also do not know

Rhyming with same words, that I know

It's nice to meet you, I hope you know

When are you coming back? I want to know

This is the ending, that you should know.
